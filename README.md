BLUF: This project provides high-quality atomic Anki flashcards which cover a myriad general knowledge topics, of the sort which might be asked about on “Jeopardy!”

This is the Ultimate Everything Deck.

Hello! Connor here! I am a huge fan of the game show "Jeopardy!" and an avid user of the spaced repetition program Anki. After being inspired by the success of James Holzhauer, I resolved to study hard so that one day I could try competing on "Jeopardy!" myself. I use Anki for my study goals, and I've spent hundreds of hours laboring over creating an ultimate high-quality Anki deck which covers a myriad general knowledge topics. The deck is far from comprehensive, but that's because creating a deck about everything is a perpetual work-in-progress! At the time of publication, the Ultimate Everything Deck contains more than 20,000 high-quality flashcards, and that number increases every single day!

For the first time, I am now proud to share my creation (and my soon-to-follow updates to it!) with the Anki community. This deck is geared towards helping somebody prepare for the game show "Jeopardy!" But even if you have more modest goals, like just trying to improve your bar trivia skills, or just trying to keep your mind sharp with lifelong learning, I know that you will find use in this powerful tool that I've spent so many hours to build and share. :)

While the overwhelming majority of the content in this deck is my own work, there are several shared decks made by other contributors which I partially-incorporated into my own Ultimate Everything Deck! In the interests of full disclosure and of giving credit to those other amazing contributors, those premade decks were:

•	https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/2109889812 - Ultimate Geography
•	https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1528423709 - Canadian Geography
•	https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/928080649   - Australian Geography
•	https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/201707643   - German Geography
•	https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/3066506982 - Chinese Geography
•	https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/685421036   - Great Works of Art
•	https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/490209917   - Periodic Table Memory Pegs
•	https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1748074213 - Greek Alphabet
•	https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/2532732904 - ASL Fingerspelling

(Warning: If you already use any of the premade decks that I’ve listed, downloading the Ultimate Everything Deck will edit your cards to look the same way that they look in my deck, including all the edits and tweaks I have made to them. If you don’t want that to happen, download the Ultimate Everything Deck to a separate Anki profile and manually remove the shared deck cards before you merge the file into your own profile’s collection.)

Highlights of the Deck:

•	At almost 1,500 cards, the “Mythology” tag is probably the crown jewel of the deck. It is wonderful for learning Greek and Roman mythology. It’s very comprehensive, and if you learned that tag, you would never again miss a single Jeopardy! question on classical mythology. It touches briefly on Norse, Egyptian, Polynesian, and Mesopotamian mythologies, but those civilizations are not comprehensive yet, and they will be expanded later.

•	The “UltimateGeographyRemastered” is the second-best tag in the deck. It is very detailed, and it includes many many many bodies of water, islands, mountains, deserts, capes, peninsulas, and other geographic features that the original Ultimate Geography shared deck does not include.

•	Other decent tags: “Landmarks,” “Military,” “Animals,” and “American History.”

Notes for Users:

•	To get started with this deck, simply download the attached Anki collection file, and then import it into Anki. From there, you have multiple options for how to proceed: 

  o	You could try learning the cards in random order. I wouldn’t necessarily recommend such an approach, because in some cases, you will end up learning disjointed information without context, making it harder to remember cards than it would be if you learned similar information around the same time.

  o	You could try learning the cards in the reverse order in which they were created. This is probably a pretty good approach, because I got better making Anki cards as time went on, and you will be starting by learning really solidly-made cards! The downside to this approach is that some of the most-recently made cards are built off of basic concepts from cards which were made a long time ago. For example, by running this approach, you won’t see many basic world geography for quite a while, because those were among the first cards to be created for this deck.
  
  o	You could try learning the cards in the order in which they were created. This is an order to the cards which I personally found success using. But there are two main downsides to this approach. First, because a small portion of this Ultimate Everything Deck is built from existing premade decks, and because those premade have much earlier creation dates than cards I made, the premade decks will be entirely lumped together at the start of this method. Using this method would take you through ASL fingerspelling, then through US state geography, Canadian provinces, a whole lot of great works of art, the periodic table, Australian states, German states, and a couple other minor topics. And this can be problematic, because if you’re not too interested in art for example, it might be a bit of a slog to go through 1,000 art cards near the beginning of your use of this deck. The second downside to this ordered approach is that once you move out of premade deck territory, you will be starting with the cards I’ve made which are the relative weakest and worst-built (because I built them when I was not as experienced with Anki). My cards got a lot better with time, and you might prefer to start off with better-made cards first. 
  
•	You should suspend cards liberally if you’re not interested in learning them. If you have no interest in memorizing the periodic table, then don’t waste your time doing it, just search for tag:PeriodicTableDeck and suspend them all. Same with Chinese Geography or US Postal Codes, or whichever other topic you might not be keen on learning.

•	If there's any flaw with the Ultimate Everything Deck, it's that the deck isn't tagged very well. Some 10,000 cards deep into this project, I decided that it was not an efficient use of my time to tag the deck (because it was a huge time sink for relatively little return on investment). I may change my mind on later and resume tagging again, but for now, several thousand cards in the deck are untagged, and most expansion cards I plan to release in the future will likely be untagged. That’s not to say that the tags in existence are useless – to the contrary, some tags are quite strong (for example, the aforementioned "UltimateGeographyRemastered" + "Mythology" tags, or "StateQuarters" + “Birthstones”). But for the most part, the tags in the deck are imperfectly handled.

•	I got better and better at making cards as time went on. Some of the first topics I tackled (for example, Greek mythology, or the American Revolution) contain a few redundant or suboptimal cards. Nowadays, whenever an imperfect card pops up in my reviews, I flag it, and I fix all flagged cards at the end of each day. As time goes on, I hope to make this shared deck better and better with each iteration.

•	I made tens of thousands of cards for this deck, and it's possible I got something wrong somewhere in the deck. Contact me on Reddit at /user/AnkiJeopardyHelp, and I will fix any error that you find!
