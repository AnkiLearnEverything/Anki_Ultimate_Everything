# Anki_Ultimate_Everything
BLUF: This project provides high-quality atomic Anki flashcards which cover a myriad general knowledge topics. The Ultimate Everything Deck.

Hello! Connor here! I am a huge fan of the game show "Jeopardy!" and an avid user of the spaced repetition program Anki. After being inspired by the success of James Holzhauer, I resolved to study hard so that one day I could try competing on on "Jeopardy!" myself. I use Anki for my study goals, and I've spent hundreds of hours laboring over creating an ultimate high-quality Anki deck which covers a myriad general knowledge topics. The deck is far from comprehensive, but that's because creating a deck about everything is a perpetual work-in-progress! And this is a project on which I intend to continue making progress. At the time of publication, the Ultimate Everything Deck contains more than 20,000 high-quality flashcards, and that number increases every single day!

For the first time, I am now sharing my creation (and my constant updates to it!) with the Anki community. This deck was geared towards helping somebody prepare for the game show "Jeopardy!" But even if  you are just trying to improve your bar trivia skills, or you're trying to keep your mind sharp with lifelong learning, I know that you will find use in this powerful tool that I've spent so many hours to build and share. :)

While the overwhelming majority of the content in this deck is my own work, there are several shared decks made by other contributors which I partially-incorporated into my own Ultimate Everything Deck! In the interests of full disclosure and of giving credit to those other amazing contributors, those premade decks were:

Notes for users: 

- If there's a flaw with the Ultimate Everything Deck, it's that the deck isn't completely tagged. Some 10,000 cards deep into this project, I decided that it was not an efficient use of my time to tag the deck (huge time sink for relataively little return on investment). I may change my mind on later and resume tagging again, but for now, several thousand cards in the deck are untagged, and all expansion cards I plan to release in the future will likely be untagged. Some tags are quite strong (for example "UltimateGeographyRemastered" + "Mythology" + "StateQuarters"). But for the most part, the tags in the deck are imperfectly handled.

- I got better and better at making cards as time went on. Some of the first topics I tackled (for example, Greek mythology or the American Revoltuion) contain a few redundant or suboptimal cards. I am constantly pruning my imperfect old cards whenever they pop up in my reviews.

- I made tens of thousands of cards for this deck, and it's possible I got something wrong somewhere in the deck. If you notice any incorrect information in the deck, please contact me on Reddit at /user/AnkiJeopardyHelp. I will fix the error!
